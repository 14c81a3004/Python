Python
> High leval lang
> Scripting and OOPS
> Automation
> Built on C

Data Types:
	>Int
	>Str
	>Float
	>Boolean
	>Complex

variables : Used to store data in the forms of data types
			> In python no need to declare the variables
			> We can just assign the value in the form of data-types
			> Re-usabilty

Functionality's: 
			> User based > Devoloped by devolopers
			> Standerd   > Devoloped by python devolopers > These are stored in cache
			Ex: Import sys

Data Processing : performing operations by using operators on top of data is called as data processing
				> we can done the data processing or oprations by using operators

Operators : operators are 8 types
			1. Arthematic (+,-,*,/)
			2. Relational (<,>,<=,==,!=) *always result must be boolean * Used for comparision
			3. Logical    (and, not, or) *Used for combinations
			4. Bitwise
			5. Assignment
			6. Membership
			7. Identity
			8. Ternary

Interpretaion: conversion of high leval lang to low leval is called interpretation
